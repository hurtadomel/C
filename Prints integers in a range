// This program asks asks the user to input two integers L and U (representing the lower and upper limits of the interval), and print out all integers in the range L â‰¤ i < U separated by spaces.

 int L, U; //declares L and U integers. 
 
 cout << "Please enter L: " << endl; //asks the user to input the lower bound
 cin>> L; 
 
 cout << "Please enter U: " << endl; //asks the user to input the upper bound
 cin >> U; 
 
 for(int i = L; i<U; i++) //starts at lower bound and prints each int until it gets to the upper bound. 
 {
 	cout << i << " "; //prints each number on the same line, separated by a space.
