//This program asks the user to input an integer in the range 0<n<100 and if the number is out of range, the program will keep asking to re-enter until a valid number is input. Once a valid value is obtained, print n squared. 

#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 

int main()
{
	int value; //declares value as an integer
	
	cout << "Please enter an integer: " << endl; // first tells the user to input an int
	
	while(true) //as long as it's true 
	{
		cin >> value; // take in value that user inputted 
		if(value > 0 && value <100) // if the value is greater than 0 and less than 100,
		{
			break; //break from while loop and go to next instructions 
		}
		cout << "Please re-enter: " << endl; //if it's not greater than 0 and less than 100, please re-enter.
	} // while loop keeps going until a number that works is chosen. 
	
	cout << value * value << endl; // when the number meets the parameter, print the square of the number
